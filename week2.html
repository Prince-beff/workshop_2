      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        I'm the kind of person who walks into a room and quietly notices the
        little things others miss, like a plant that needs water or a joke
        waiting to be made. I balance curiosity with a laid-back vibe, always
        ready to try something new but never rushing into anything without a
        moment of thought. People find it easy to talk to me because I listen
        with genuine interest, and even though I don’t always show it. Whether
        exploring a new hobby, getting lost in music, or just chilling with my
        own thoughts, I carry a mix of calm confidence and quiet determination
        that makes my presence feel steady and real. I appreciate the kind of
        moments that most people overlook the sound of soft rain tapping on a
        window, the warmth of sunlight sneaking through the trees, or the
        laughter shared during a simple conversation. I’m not someone who chases
        loud attention; I prefer the kind of presence that speaks quietly but
        meaningfully. I believe every person I meet has a story, and I try to
        understand people beyond their first impression, giving them space to
        express who they really are.

            In the far reaches of the northern world, where the wind carved
            scars into the earth and the sea roared like a wounded beast, a boy
            once stood upon the frozen shore and wondered what it meant to live
            without chains. He had seen warriors raise their swords toward the
            heavens as if demanding answers from gods who never listened, had
            heard men shout of glory while the ground beneath them drank their
            blood, and had watched villages burn under the cold, indifferent
            stare of the moon. Yet even in those flames, even in that endless
            winter, he felt something stirring within him a tiny ember
            refusing to be extinguished. It was the memory of warmth from a
            distant past: a father's voice telling him that true strength was
            not in taking life, but in protecting it; a mother's trembling hands
            reminding him that the world was wide, and beyond its cruelty
            existed places where the soil was soft and nothing grew from hatred.
            Still, as he walked through fields of corpses and heard the dying
            whisper their regrets into the wind, he couldn't believe such a
            place truly existed. The world he knew was built upon revenge,
            sharpened by grief, and fed by the endless hunger of men who mistook
            violence for purpose. Every battle shaped him, every scream echoed
            in his chest, every sword swing carved deeper into his soul until he
            could no longer tell whether he was chasing justice or running from
            his own emptiness. He had once believed enemies were monsters
            wearing human faces, but as he stared into their terrified eyes, he
            realized they were simply reflections of himself lost, wounded,
            desperate for someone to teach them how to be more than the weapons
            their lives had forged them into.

            Warriors marched, kings plotted, and the world continued its
            ceaseless cycle of conquest, but he began to understand that the
            strongest man was not the one who conquered nations, but the one who
            conquered his own heart. In the dead silence of winter nights, he
            dreamed of a land untouched by anger, where wheat fields swayed like
            golden waves and children ran freely without fear of arrows falling
            from the sky. A place where the scars of the past could dissolve
            into the earth and new seeds could grow in their place. Vinland — a
            word whispered like a prayer, a promise, a distant horizon
            shimmering beyond the reach of blood-stained hands. And though he
            carried the weight of countless sins, though his past clung to him
            like a shadow that refused to die, he kept walking. Through storms
            that threatened to break him, through loneliness that hollowed his
            chest, through battles that tested the very meaning of his existence
            — he walked. Because somewhere within him, beneath all the rage and
            sorrow, lived a vow that no sword could cut: that he would never
            again become a slave to hatred. That he would break the chains
            passed down through generations of warriors. That he would build a
            life worthy of the loved ones he lost. And with every step, he felt
            the world shift — not because the world had changed, but because he
            had. He learned that mercy was harder than murder, that forgiveness
            weighed heavier than steel, and that true courage was not born on
            the battlefield but in the quiet refusal to repeat the sins of the
            past.
